Voltage Drop = Resistor/Reistance Total * Voltage Input

Ex) A 12 VDC input has 3 resistors in series [120, 100, 50]. What is the voltage drop across each resistor?

Voltage Drop R1 = (120 / 270) * 12 = 5.33
Voltage Drop R2 = (100 / 270) * 12 = 4.44
Voltage Drop R3 = ( 50 / 270) * 12 = 2.22
Voltage Drop Sum = 11.99 VDC

Input Voltage: 12
Number of resistors: 3
Resistor Value:120
Resistor Value:100
Resistor Value:50
[120.0, 100.0, 50.0]
270.0
[5.33, 4.44, 2.22]
