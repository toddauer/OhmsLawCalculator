# PythonCalculators
uses Ohm's law formulas and if conditions to know what you are trying to calculate


If using these calculators in micro python:
You will have to remove 'while True' in place of-
i = True
while i == 'True'
  code**

You will have to remove sqrt and ** in place of-
variable = inputA * inputA #where inputA = whatever the number you are trying to raise to the second power
& 
sqrt = inputA * inputA * (1/2) #where inputA = whatever the number you are trying to square root.
